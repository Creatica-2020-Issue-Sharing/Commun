# Commun

**Project for the Creatica 2022 Hackathon**

Commun is an internet forum used for the discussion of human rights violations within your community. It was created as a catalyst for change and growth within communities by motivating others to speak on issues within their communities, and form and share opinions to build a stronger community.
